            <p>"After all, [the world] is on my side. That is, I’m a part of it. Not separate from it.

            <p>"It wants our bodies,<br>the landscape does, and everyone runs the risk of<br>being swallowed up. Can we love nature for what it<br>really is: predatory? We do not walk through a passive<br>landscape."<br>—Richard Silken, <a href="http://versedaily.org/2015/fruitrotmillipede.shtml">Landscape with Fruit Rot and Millipede</a></p>

            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/bouncymushrooms.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"As I pondered a pronoun change I began to think of gender less as a scale and more as a landscape. Some people are born in the mountains, while others are born by the sea. Some people are happy to live in the place they were born, while others must make a journey to reach the climate in which they can flourish and grow. Between the ocean and the mountains is a wild forest. That is where I want to make my home."<br>—Maia Kobabe, <a href="https://onipress.com/products/gender-queer-a-memoir">Gender Queer</a></p>

            <p>"There is no mystery in this association of woods and otherworlds, for as anyone who has walked in woods knows, they are places of correspondence, of call and answer. Visual affinities of colour, relief and texture abound…Different aspects of the forest link unexpectedly with each other, and so it is that within the stories of forests, different times and worlds can be joined."<br>—Robert Macfarlane, <a href="https://archive.org/details/wildplaces0000macf">The Wild Places</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/bouncymushrooms.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"A forest is what exists between its trees, between its dense undergrowth and its clearings, between all its life cycles and their different timescales … A forest is also a meeting place between those who enter it and something unnameable and attendant, waiting behind a tree or in the undergrowth. Something intangible and within touching distance. Neither silent nor audible."<br>—John Berger, Into the Woods from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sublime">The Sublime</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/bouncymushrooms.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            
            <p>"Be my mother, I said<br>to the trees, in the language of trees, which can't be transcribed,<br>and they shook their hair back, and they bent low with their<br>many arms, and they looked into my eyes as only trees can<br>look into the eyes of a person, they touched me with the rain<br>on their fingers till I was all droplets, till I was mist, and they said<br>that they would."<br>—Emily Berry, <a href="https://poemfortheday.blogspot.com/2018/09/canopy-emily-berry-weather-was-inside.html">Canopy</a></p>

            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/bouncymushrooms.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"you didn’t know your name until they named you. didn’t know your teeth were fangs until they tried to pry them from your pliant skull, didn’t know your hunger was so unclean. so you learned to grow in the dark as darkness grew in you."<br>—Sam Sax, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th-DX-QwqgU">It's Alive</a></p>
