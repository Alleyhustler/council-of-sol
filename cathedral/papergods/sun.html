            <p>☼ "If you could<br>destroy the story before it started, would you—<br><br>go back—before the unnameable thing?"<br>—Rachel McKibbens, <a href="https://vinylpoetryandprose.com/2016/05/rachel-mckibbens/">outhouse</a> from <a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/blud-by-rachel-mckibbens/">blud</a></p>

            <p>☼ "be who you are, even if it kills you.<br><br>it will. over and over again<br>even as you live."<br>—Joy Harjo, <a href="https://poetry2o17.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/break-my-heart-by-joy-harjo/">break my heart</a> from <a href="https://www.joyharjo.com/book/an-american-sunrise">An American Sunrise</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>☼ "There is a relationship between rebirth and realization.  You do not always know when you are reborn; you may wander around in your own life, feeling in-between two things that you can't recognize or name.  When it dawns on you that you have been reborn, that you are not the person you used to be, you shed that veild haze of confusion, the one that's left behind from the dead version of you, thinking it's still alive.  The ghost that inhibited you before the realization passes over, fades away, and you can come into yourself again and carry on."<br>—Selene Corbeau, <a href="https://cemeterythoughts.substack.com/p/new-year-new-me-reflections-on-rebirth">New Year, New Me: Reflections on Rebirth</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>☼ "You will always fall in love, and it will always be like having your throat cut, just that fast. You will always run away with her. You will always lose her. You will always be a fool. You will always be dead, in a city of ice, snow falling into your ear. You have already done all of this and will do it again."<br>—Catherynne M. Valente, <a href="https://www.catherynnemvalente.com/deathless">Deathless</a></p>

            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>“But here’s a little secret for you: no one is ever the same thing again after anything. You are never the same twice, and much of your unhappiness comes from trying to pretend that you are. Accept that you are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for the gift it is. Work within the desires and goals of the person you are currently, until you aren’t that person anymore, and everything changes once again.”<br>—Welcome to Night Vale, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0oI1UMyhPO0ejNKZQesP0i?si=f7412ca65bf44938">Through the Narrow Place</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"What an age! Every one is dying, everything is dying, and the earth is dying also, eaten up by the sun and the wind.  I don't know where I get the courage to keep on living in the midst of these ruins.  Let us love each other to the end."<br>—George Sand (Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) in her letter to Gustave Flaubert dated 27 June 1870, featured in <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924027323587">The George Sand-Gustave Flaubert letters</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"I make the tremendous effort to rise again, not to wallow anymore, not to go on just suffering or burning."<br>—Anaïs Nin, <a href="https://archive.org/details/henryjunefromune00nina">Henry and June</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"As I grow older, much older, I will experience many things, and I will hit rock bottom again and again. Again and again I will suffer; again and again I will get back on my feet.  I will not be defeated.  I won't let my spirit be destroyed.<br>—Banana Yoshimoto, <a href="https://archive.org/details/kitchen00yosh">Kitchen</a> translated by Megan Backus</p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"I am so busy. I am practicing<br>my new hobby of watching me<br>become someone else. There is<br>so much violence in reconstruction.<br> Each minute is grisly, but I have<br>to participate. I am building<br>what I cannot break."<br>—Jennifer Willough, from "The Sun Is Still A Part of Me", <a href="https://milkweed.org/book/beautiful-zero">Beautiful Zero</a></p>

            <p>"Sometimes an abyss opens between Tuesday and Wednesday<br>but twenty-six years could pass in a moment. Time is not a straight line, it's<br>more of a labyrinth, and if you press close to the wall at the right place you<br>can hear the hurrying steps and the voices, you can hear yourself walking<br>past on the other side."<br>—Tomas Tranströmer, <a href="https://inwardboundpoetry.blogspot.com/2007/11/519-answers-to-letters-tomas.html">Answers to Letters</a> translated by Robin Fulton</p>

            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>"Understanding all the ways fear stands in he way of our knowing love challenges us. Fearful that believing in love's truths and letting them guide our lives will lead to further betrayal, we hold back from love when our hearts are full of longing.  Being loving does not mean we will not be betrayed. Lvoe helps us face betrayal without losing heart. And it renews our spirit so we can love again."<br>—bell hooks, <a href="https://archive.org/details/allaboutlove00bell">All About Love</a></p>
            <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
           <p>“That’s how you get deathless, volchitsa. Walk the same tale over and over, until you wear a groove in the world, until even if you vanished, the tale would keep turning, keep playing, like a phonograph, and you’d have to get up again, even with a bullet through your eye, to play your part and say your lines.”<br>—Catherynne M. Valente, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765326317/deathless">Deathless</a></p>
           <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
           <p>"Language itself is a revenant – that is, <i>a ghost that walks again by repeating and being repeatable</i>. It is older than the speaker, and it will live long after the speaker has died, thus indicating a future to come that is a repetition of the past and the present but still different. Language speaks the speaker, as if ghosts of past generations <em>possesses</em> them in order for them to express themselves to ghosts of the present as well as those of the future."<br>— Line Henriksen, <a href="https://utpjournals.press/doi/ref/10.3138/utq.87.1.266">“Spread the Word”: Creepypasta, Hauntology, and an Ethics of the Curse</a></p>

           <img src="../../graphics/dividers/goldrod.gif" style="max-width:100%;">
           <p>"We collide with place, which<br>is another name for God, and limp away with a<br>permanent injury. Ask for a blessing? You can try,<br>but we will not remain unscathed.<br>—Richard Silken, <a href="http://versedaily.org/2015/fruitrotmillipede.shtml">Landscape with Fruit Rot and Millipede</a></p>
