            <div>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wTDsCplARY"><img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/remmy.jpg" alt="Furret" title="REMMY MY BOY" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:left;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px;"></a>
              <h4>Remmington aka Remmy</h4>
              <p>Furret is my favourite pokemon, though for a long time, I never felt like I had a favourite!  Until I caught Remmington and he and a team of normal types carried me through the elite four in SoulSilver.  I was so, so sad when there was no sentret or furret in Sword/Shield, and am still on the hunt for one in Brilliant Diamond so Remmy's legacy will live on. He is truly my best boy.</p>
            </div>
              <br><center><img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/divfurret2.gif" style="max-width:100%;"></center><br>
            <div style="text-align:right;">
              <img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/hotdog.jpg" alt="Quagsire" title="Loam aka Hotdog" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:right;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px;">
              <h4>Loam aka Hotdog</h4>
              <p>I've always loved quagsires.  I've had a plush one since I was a kid when quagsire was new!  But I'd never had one on a team until I played through Sword.  My little dude was a KILLER and carried me through the Championship and all of the DLC.  He is now living a cushy retirement as I catch and train lots of other pokemon for funsies but still enjoys extended camping trips in the wild area and mountainous plates of curry.</p>
            </div>
              <br><center><img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/divfurret2.gif" style="max-width:100%;"></center><br>
            <div>
              <img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/hozier.jpg" alt="Wooloo" title="Hozier (yes, named after *that* hozier)" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:left;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px;">
              <h4>Hozier</h4>
              <p>No, I didn't keep Hozier as a wooloo forever, but think of this like me showing you baby photos like a very proud parent, okay?</p>
              <p>Like the rest of the internet, I too fell in love with this goofy rolly sheep and caught one asap when I was playing Sword.  I got lucky with fluffy as his ability, and much like Loam, he's currently enjoying retirement after the Championship and taking lots of naps as close to a fireplace as possible without actually catching fire.</p>
            </div>
              <br><center><img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/divfurret2.gif" style="max-width:100%;"></center><br>
            <div style="text-align:center;">
              <img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/cheddar.jpg" alt="Bibarel" title="one cheesy boy" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:left;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:5px;">
              <img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/gouda.jpg" alt="Bibarel" title="two cheesy boy" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:right;padding-left:12px;padding-bottom:5px;">
              <h4>Cheddar & Gouda</h4>
              <p>Look at these boys.  The cheesiest of boys.  Did I mean to go through Brilliant Diamond with two bidoofs, now bibarels?  No.  Am I doing it because I caught both of these guys while trying to decide which ability would be better for my team and got attached to both of them?  Yes.</p>
              <p>Real talk though, simple ability and defense curl and rollout has been a killer combination so far.</p>
            </div>
              <br><center><img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/divfurret2.gif" style="max-width:100%;"></center><br>
            <div style="text-align:right;">
              <img src="../../../graphics/pokemon/sebastian.jpg" alt="Lopunny" title="Sebastian" style="width:150px;height:150px;float:right;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px;">
              <h4>Sebastian aka Sebby</h4>
              <p>I played the crap out of Diamond when it originally came out, and always always always caught a kricketot and a lopunny.  With the release of Brilliant Diamond, Sebastian has made his valliant return to my roster.  Still a lil miffed that lopunny is still a mono-normal type, but he still packs a punch.  (or a kick when hi-jump kick manages to actually land.)</p>
            </div>

              <h4>Tallie</h4>
              <p>The surprise star of Paldea!  She is my LORGE GIRL and will take every hit and dish it right back to her opponents without a sweat.  She single handedly took out multiple bosses including elite four members, and she deserves all of the sandwiches for her fortitude.  I am still working through the Indigo Disk DLC and am trying to diversify a bit, but she will always have a spot on the team.</p>
