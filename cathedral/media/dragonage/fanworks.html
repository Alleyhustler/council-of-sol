            <p>This isn't a comprehensive list, I'm just slowly working on adding things, so you may notice trends especially as I bounce around the shipping wall. As a general fandom reminder, please note the author tags on any of the Ao3 works as I'm an adult and not all of the works below may be suitable for you!

            <p><a href="https://maythedreadwolftakeyou.tumblr.com/tagged/dragon age embroidery">May the Dread Wolf Take You</a> and <a href="https://hattedhedgehog.tumblr.com/tagged/dragon age embroidery">Hatted Hedgehog</a> have the most beautiful embroidery that I just need other people to know exists?</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.eriart.net/dafd.html">Dragon Age Fan Deck</a> by Erika Hollice and Jacqueline Miller</p>

            <p><a href="https://missnovelist.tumblr.com/">MissNovelist</a> has been working on transcribing all of Dragon Age: Inquisition and has the undertaking hosted over at <a href="https://genitivichronicles.wordpress.com/">Genitivi Chronicles</a> which is one hell of an undertaking!</p>
            <p>Grogblogging made this map to determine <a href="https://grogblogging.tumblr.com/post/139327010450/travel-times-in-thedas-i-am-a-terrible">travel times in Thedas</a> complete with links to information on transportation speeds/methods??  I live for this shit.</p>
            <p>KinlochHold has done a few things including putting together a <a href="https://kinlochhold.tumblr.com/damediatimeline">Dragon Age Media Timeline</a> and much more impressively the <a href="https://kinlochhold.tumblr.com/post/139422945522/i-had-hoped-to-be-able-to-offer-a-complete-and">Dragon Age Codex Compendium</a>.</p>
            <p>I would be embarassed not to mention FenxShiral's <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/229061">Project Elvhen</a> which is hosted on Ao3 but check out <a href="https://fenxshiral.tumblr.com/PEFAQ">his FAQ</a> and his <a href="https://fenxshiral.tumblr.com/tagged/project elvhen">tumblr</a> for more info or answers to more questions.</p>
            <h3>fanfic</h3>
            <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7691092/chapters/17521513">of roses & hello </a>by heartslogos, <i>Iron Bull x Fem!Inquisitor Lavellan</i> - I very literally read most of this in a week while dealing with some insomnia, but I love love loved the author's Lavellan.  Bonus, it was really nice to read some ace romance stuff. ;u;</p>
            <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25126000/chapters/60876319">leave it to the land, this is what it knows</a> by CheskaNova, <i>Iron Bull x F!Lavellan with Dorian x M!Inquisitor Lavellan in the background</i> - I love Aldae and I love her inquisitor brother, and I'm a sucker for sibling dynamics. I'm subscribed to this one as it's still in progress (as of January 2023), and I'm so excited every time there's an update.</p>
            <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/32228896/chapters/79872607">A Friend</a> by AntlersandFangs, <i>Iron Bull x F!Lavellan x OC</i> - I'm struggling to find the right words to explain my love for this one.  It makes my heart swell and ache a little bit.  There's something about the feeling of safety and overcoming grief that gets to me.</p>
            <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27689668/chapters/67763878">Rooting a Cutting</a> by AntlersandFangs, <i>Iron Bull x OC</i> - I actually read this before A Friend (they're unrelated stories), and I loved it so much that I went through the author's other works after reading this.  It was nice to see an autistic and asexual character loved so much.</p>
            <p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/283891/chapters/452052">In the Shadow of the Gallows</a> by Flutiebreat, <i>Merrill x Carver</i> - This fic is SO LONG and it'll never be finished, but be still my heart.</p>
            <p>May I humbly recommend delving into <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/tagged/dragon age">my dragon age tag</a> over on tumblr to get you started fishing for neat/stupid content.  (I literally have more Dragon Age content on my blog than anything else, whoops.)  Otherwise I'm working on adding some cool fan music to the audio player on this page. =)</p>
