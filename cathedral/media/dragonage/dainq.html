            <h2>Dragon Age: Inquisition</h2>
            <p>Inquisition was the first Dragon Age game where I was invested in the franchise prior to release and was a part of the pre-release hype train, and it was definitely a unique experience!  We all had so many hopes for the game, and while the hard work of the devs definitely shines through, the game was <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/145241168220/30-day-video-game-challenge-day-22-a-game">a buggy fucking mess</a> on release (spoilers, it's still the same kind of buggy almost a decade later) and still managed to win <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/106127091425/stop-right-there-criminal-scum-game-of-the-year">game of the year</a>.  We got <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/172116789260/silksieve-im-reading-blood-sweat-and-pixels">some information</a> about the development process for DAI after which explained a lot of things that fell flat (like the main villain/ending to the main game feeling anti-climactic), but the game widely amounted to a lot of mixed feelings, completely fair criticisms, and a fair bit of <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/146372128305/dr-jekyl-actualtriss-tbh-i-think-the-reason">disappointment</a>.</p>
            <p>Personally, I really like the gameplay loop for Inquisition because (and I know this is awful) I really like the satisfaction of clearing the map of every single stupid fetch quest and icon and being smugly pleased with myself.  It has really wonderful character moments with music that tugs at your heart and I did in fact shed tears over this game, but it feels like there is so much distance between those points in gameplay sometimes and without mods you miss out on huge chunks of them.</p>
            <p>At this point you're probably asking why I have a shrine to a game I can complain about this much, and honestly, I'm pretty sure that's how the whole fandom copes because I know I'm not the only one who has a love hate relationship here.  I love revisiting the game every so often partially because of all the little details in the game, because of all of the time and investment I have in my inquisitors and their relationships with the NPCs, romantice and otherwise.</p>
