  						  <center><img src="../graphics/dividers/carousel.gif"></center>

  							 <center><img src="../graphics/dividers/carousel.gif"></center>
  							 <p>12/24/2023 | Longer <a href="index.html">journal update</a> than usual because I'm apparently feeling verbose and reflective on this merry Christmas Eve.

							  <p>11/29/2023 | Making real time tests in the <a href="../thunderdome/index.html">Thunderdome</a> to try to make the new layout mobile friendly.  Realized <em>every page</em> had a tiny little detail that needed to be changed, so uh, did that for the whole site, lmao.  Also updated the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37Feh10nJgfAz6GhMwspuk">guestbook playlist</a> again as well as added it to <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk9QsdwlPwJfmIf7sMq0sMpDjBhyWriq0&amp;si=OsHvLaM1DlGu09sf">Youtube Music</a>!  Thank you as always to everyone who's shared a song and for all of your lovely comments~</p>

    						<p>11/26/2023 | Migrated my collections, journal, and graphics pages over to the v2 layout which should mean that everything is migrated over! Now just to make it all mobile friendly again, hahaha... Also started updating my Credits page and made some tweaks to my noteboard.  (Things will probs be a little slow around here again until closer to Christmas while I tackle some irl things and deal with the busy season at work.)</p>
    					<center><img src="../graphics/dividers/carousel.gif"></center>
    						<p>11/25/2023 | Dryad Glen v2 is here!  Still skimming all the pages for broken links/images, and I'll slowly be updating my graphics/toy box pages in the coming weeks, but I'm so happy to have her updated.  =3</p>
