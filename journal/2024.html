                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodmusic.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 12/26/2024 | Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, happy Yule, and happy belated Solstice to you all!  (And if I've missed your holiday of the season, well wishes and I hope your celebrations were/are joyous!)  I just wanted to pop in and say hi and make some little updates to Dryad Glen before the end of the year.  It's been one heck of a year!</p>
                <p>My partner and I moved into our first apartment <i>alone</i> together (even though we've been living together since 2020), and we just celebrated a year of having a place of our own.  My office is closed for Christmas and New Years, so I've been taking the time to speed organize all the boxes we still haven't unpacked and do some decorating.  I even finally got <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/770518149485527040/it-took-a-full-year-after-moving-in-but-i-finally">all of our books unpacked</a> and onto my poor overworked bookshelf who I've had since middle school (and maybe needs a little structural reinforcement!).  It feels magical to actually have all of our books together on the same shelf after all these years, and I'm even more delighted to get to see all of my Dad's old Eberron books on my shelf together. (Thanks Dad<img src="../graphics/smol/twinkle.gif">)</p>
                <p>We also got to celebrate our first Thanksgiving <i>and</i> Christmas to ourselves which felt selfishly decadent.  I made a <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/768445831815856128/no-thanksgiving-travel-and-no-friendsgiving-this">mini Thanksgiving dinner</a> for us including ham (requested by my partner), greenbean casserole (requested by meeeeee), scalloped potatoes, cranberry sauce, and Hawaiian rolls which was perfect, and for Christmas I made <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/770805661403676672/christmas-lasagna-was-also-a-success">lasagna</a> to mix it up!  I also made some of my belated aunt's pumpkin cookies finally and cooked some spiced chocolate chip cookes for my manager at work and am doing more baking today!  Part of my mad dash of cleaning in the days leading up to Christmas was because I needed to clear space to set up our folding table as an interim desk for my partner as I got him a monitor for his gaming PC!  He was delightfully surprised to find it when he got home on Christmas Eve, and we literally spent all of Christmas afternoon playing games together to try it out.  It was fun to be able to get him a gift he was so happy with~</p>
                <p>I'm trying to be optimistic that my medical stuff that started after my birthday is finally resolving as well.  Hopefully one ER surgery and two additional surgeries is enough!  @___@  My last surgery was the week before Thanksgiving and recovery this time has not been as easy as I'd hoped, but my surgeon said everything was looking good at my postop visit.  With my insurance maxed for the year, I was also able to get a bump I've had for some time removed and biopsied.  Just fatty tissue!  (Which I expected because of family history, but if you get a bump, that doesn't go away, please go to the doctor.  I met a lot of people this year who were not so lucky, and it is always better to catch things early if you can!)</p>
                <p>We did less travelling this year (our only real trip was to see my partner's family in September), but with all our nesting, that's okay with me.  uwu  Thankfully with my parents visiting for my birthday in the Spring, and my mom visiting again in October, things didn't feel so bad, but I miss my friends in Phoenix and I need to see my desert!  I'm hoping to make that trip around my birthday for 2025 (if we go early enough we can maybe go to renfaire!), and if we can save up some money, Alaska Airlines just announced they'll be starting direct flights to Tokyo next year which is a trip both my partner and I have always wanted to make!  Still lots of planning to see if we can make it happen for 2025, but it's an exciting dream nonetheless!</p>
                <p>I'm still thinking a lot about my goals for 2025, but part of them will be returning to physical journalling and breaking down my goal setting a little more.  Even though my partner lovingly bought me a Hobonichi weeks for me to try out on our 2023 anniversary trip to Portland, it mostly fell by the wayside.  Which is so sad because I love that paper and it is so cute!!  But I am realizing that part of why physical journals are good for me are novelty and versatility.  I love the novelty of different decor and layouts regardless of how minimalist or maximalist I can make them which keeps me visually and creatively engaged with it, but also my journalling needs are very diverse and change from week to week.  A full journal of daily pages ends up with a lot of unused space!  A full journal of uniform weekly pages leaved me unengaged and bored and stifled when I'm feeling more verbose.  So I guess I'll be living my best blank grid notebook life into the future!</p>
                <p>I realized this year once my health stuff came into play that I wasn't going to reach mooooost of my goals, so I ended up making a smaller, more focused goal list for the year, but on reflection, I still made progress toward a lot of those original goals even if I didn't reach them in full!  And with doing my daily to do lists in Obsidian, I have more space to break down tasks by each step involved which really helps me stay on task but feel the progress that I'm making even if I don't finish a task in full on that day.  (Also surprisingly helpful for reminding me to do <a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/laundry-and-dishes-have-three-steps/">all the laundry steps</a>.)  BUT both of these made me realize that I really need to try doing this with my yearly goals including potential travel plans.  So I'm going to test setting yearly goals and then setting seasonal goals to work toward those big things, and then I'll be doing a little check-in/new goal setting with each season this year.  I'm genuinely optimistic about this set up for myself, but we'll see how it turns out!</p>
                <p>I do also want to come back to Dryad Glen a little more for 2025!  It fell by the wayside with nesting and medical things and a lot of crochet for the second half of the year, and even missed that it was my third anniversary when I made my last journal entry!  I had a lot of odds and ends on my offline to do list, and I'll be making some updates to the online list with my updates today.  =)  But I miss getting to do creative online things to share with people, and I'd like to do a better job of engaging with others' experiences in a more thoughtful way too.</p>
                <p>I guess before I head off for those other updates, it's worth mentioning that I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberneticdryad.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> now!  I was never really active on Twitter, and I'm mostly following artists and Dragon Age devs right now, but I'd love to see some more familiar faces so that I can maybe figure out how to make the platform work for me.  =)</p>
                <p>Wishing you all a peaceful and fun end to 2024!</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodcloud.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 11/16/2024 | I was driving to work the other day reflecting on why I haven't been doing a lot of "from scratch" creating lately and realized that I've been in some kind of rut since the spring.  I've been wanting to write and get back to my watercolors and make pages here again and test some new recipies I've been toying with, but when I sit down to try, everything feels so forced or lackluster or I can't bring myself to follow through.  Life has been tricky this year, and I think that all of my creative and problem solving skills have been getting used for those issues instead of the things that are actually fulfilling to me, which has been leaving my metaphorical cup pretty empty.  Thankfully following premade patterns and spinning take less of that energy so I've still been able to do some creating, but I hope I can find my way out of this thing soon.</p>
                <p>On top of the looming winter months, my ongoing medical issues, work drama, and the US predidential election results, we're also dealing with fleas in our apartment.  =')  We must have tracked them in somehow, but that's been occupying a lot of my time in the last month between having to give our poor cat a flea bath (she was a trooper), washing all of our bedding and blankets twice a week, and vacuuming as often as humanly possible. Fleas are tenacious, and especially during winter months their eggs like to lay dormant, so I'm bracing to basically be in this deep cleaning loop through most of the season.  I feel awful for our cat though, she's overgroomed her back legs and she's so cold all the time now.  =C  I've been bundling her up in blankets during the day when I'm home which has been keeping her cozy, but I hope her fur grows back soon!</p>
                <p>I know I kinda glossed over it, but I know the US election results have been weighing heavily on folks, myself included.  Finding out people you thought shared your beliefs and values don't (again), the uncertainty of what will happen in the next four years, the blatant disregard for the political systems which are supposed to act as checks and balances.  I don't know that I've fully digested it myself.  <a href="https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/11/10-things-to-do-if-trump-wins/">This article</a> from Daniel Hunter at Waging Nonviolence has been doing the rounds on tumblr (and even my no-longer-tumblrite brother sent it to me) which was a pretty grounding read, as is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrose.ink/post/3lah7oq26ha23">this thread</a> over on Bluesky.  If you're like myself and are looking for ways to stay up to date on executive branch news without getting massively overwhelmed, I've been reading <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/">What the Fuck Just Happened Today?</a> and signed up for their emails because newsletters work better for me than checking websites.  Take breaks.  Check-in on each other.  If you are usually the one doing the checking, ask a trusted friend to reach out periodically or set a reminder to check-in with yourself.  Make sure you're eating well and drinking enough water and taking care of yourself as best you can right now.  We're stronger together, and we can make it through together, hand in hand.</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodheart.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 09/02/2024 | Hello everyone, how has your summer been??  I feel like it's been an age since I've been on Neocities to even look for others' updates, but it's been a much needed break to focus on offline life and work on prioritizing things.  =)</p>
                <p>I feel like most of what I've been working on has been crochet!  I haven't finished the summer shirt that I started around LYS Day, but I'm almost finished with the main body now.  I'll need to add the sleeves, collar, and the button section for it to be properly finished, but if nothing else, maybe I can wear it around the apartment during the winter!  I also made a lil amigurumi shark for my QPP's birthday last month, and I'm just starting on a sweater that I'd like to finish by the end of the year.  (When I'm feeling up to it, I'll get the pictures up on here as well as on Ravelry, oops.)  I'm trying <i>really hard</i> to pace myself on projects, but I think it's been a success compared to the poject burnout I usually deal with on bigger projects.</p>
                <p>We've been seeing a fair bit of our friends the past few months, especially August which I fondly refer to as my Birthday Gauntlet (7 bithdays in one month is a lot!), and I've been juggling doctor appointments and some craziness at work as well, so my time to myself has just been all about recovery and rest.  I'm still cooking a lot, and I've got a couple of new recipes I need to add to the kitchen here (though I'll have some notes about adjustments after a couple more rounds of making them).</p>
                <p>I've also been setting up Obsidian on my laptop for the past month or so!  I'm so enamoured with how customizeable it is and the versatility of markdown (even though I didn't know anything about it to start with).  I think it's going to end up a lot how my physical journals used to be (daily logs, quick notes, pasted pictures), and I think it'll streamline some of how I add content here!  I'm in the process of adding a media shelf for reviews and thoughts on stuff I've watched/read/played which is something I've been wanting to add here for a long long time, and I think it'll be beneficial for my various research projects that I'm always working on.</p>
                <p>I missed you all though, and I'm excited to be back online!  I hope you're all doing well, and I can't wait to see what you've all been up to♡</p>
              <center><img src="../graphics/dividers/cloudsnrainbows.gif"></center>
                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodpencil.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 05/05/2024 | Happy Sunday all.  =)  I'm still working on getting back to my normal routines, but mostly I've just been trying to listen to my body for the last couple of weeks.  My normal routines are mostly reinstated, but I'm still finding myself having to do things in smaller chunks or take longer breaks which may be for the best if it's a habit I can build up.  I've always been an "all in or all out" kind of person when approaching tasks, but it's definitely kept me from a lot or from actually making meaningful progress on my goals, so having to slow down and just do a little has been really helpful (especially because I am a little slow to fully digest problems and new information!).</p>
                <p>Spring's been making me feel a little... sporadic, but I'm trying to lean into that too.  I've been checking out cookbooks from the library to try to find some new cooking inspiration as I've been getting bored with Pinterest recipes.  I picked up some cotton yarn on LYS Day (aka Local Yarn Store Day) because my shop was having a sale and have committed to making a shirt for summer.  I finished my first singles and plying on my spinning wheel and it was about as perfectly unbalanced as you'd expect, and I've started spinning up this dreamy purple merino/silk roving my partner got me for my birthday as well.  I've been catching up on the latest <a href="https://www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=cyberneticdryad">Neopets</a> story things after taking a break for a couple months.  I picked up playing <a href="https://pokefarm.com/user/cyberneticdryad">Pokefarm</a> at the end of March and have been steadily filling up my Pokedex.  I also started contemplating picking up my language learning again.  I've studied Spanish, Italian, and Japanese academically (and am poorly practiced in all three at this point!), but I've been mulling over picking up Slovene or Gaeilge to get a little closer to my maternal and paternal ancestry respectively.</p>
                <p>And then I wonder why I don't have a social life!</p>
                <p>Truthfully though, it has been a nice couple of weeks after everything at the beginning of April, and I've been getting to be a little more social with my family which has been really nice.  My family is really small and most of us are kind of reclusive (which is really hard to unlearn, let me tell you!), but I've always craved those silly hangouts and phone calls and texts.  I think part of it was them worrying about me, but it would be nice if we could just keep this going too.</p>
                <p>I guess what I'm hearing from myself it that I need more consistency with the things that enrich my life!  And perhaps to stop working myself into the ground so that I'm not so bone-tired all the time.  I'm gonna go work on some site stuff now and maybe mull that over for a bit, but I hope y'all have a kind week ahead and that you're able to do something that makes you smile.</p>
              <center><img src="../graphics/dividers/cloudsnrainbows.gif"></center>
                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodflower.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 04/20/2024 | Long time no see webmasters and lurkers!!  It was not my intention to be away so long, but life had other plans for me, both good and bad.</p>
                <p>The good, my 30th birthday was the end of March!  My partner helped my parents to surprise me by flying up the weekend before to visit us, which was so incredibly fun.  I got to show them our apartment, and they finally got to meet our cat, and we got to do some fun museum/park/restaurant exploring while they were here.  (I don't regret moving so far away from home, but I do miss seeing my parents more often.  ;n; )  My partner and I also celebrated my birthday on the day of, and he bought me a spinning wheel!!!  We went to a local yarn shop where I was able to try a few of the ones I was interested in.  I'd wanted to just get some fiber and look for a used wheel later (because cost hahaha) but he insisted, so now I have a very cute <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/746532967911964672/please-ignore-my-other-junk-but-my-partner-bought">Schacht Ladybug</a> who I have yet to name.  My <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1421058878/horn-beetle-insect-spinners-control-tool">spinning control tool</a> also has a beetle on it, so I'm considering giving her a fancy bug name, but I haven't actually gotten to spin with her a whole lot!  Which I guess kinda brings us to the bad.</p>
                <p>Work was a nightmare for most of March.  My office is very small, and we lost two staff members in two different roles, so that combined with some personal emergencies other people had outside of work made scheduling kind of stressful.  Everyone was pretty on edge for most of the month, and a couple were more or less burnt out after everything.  Things seem to be settling down now though, so hopefully the rest of the year will be a little more mellow.  It did mean that I just didn't have the emotional capacity to engage with much of anything though, including bookbug which was a bummer because The Left Hand of Darkness has been on my reading list for so long!!  Alas, another opportunity will come.</p>
                <p>[CW for some medical discussion next 2 paragraphs]</p>
                <p>AND THEN, right after my birthday, I ended up having to go to urgent care.  I'd been having some pain the week before but I thought it was like, cramping because it was almost time for my period, but the day after my birthday, walking and even sitting were painful.  And urgent care wanted me to get a CT scan but couldn't me in for three days, so I just managed the pain as best I could with literally the maximum doses of over the counter pain meds that I could and even that wasn't much relief.  So I get the CT scan, and the doctor calls me not 20 minutes later and tells me to go directly to the ER because I have an abscess.  =')  I'd been under the impression that it could just be drained, but uh, it was deep enough and big enough that they actually had to do surgery, and my infection was not horriffic but bad enough that they wanted to keep me overnight.  Thankfully, the staff were all very nice and explained things very well, and honestly for an ER experience, from arrival to getting out of surgery, it was only like 7 hours, which I'm beyond grateful for.  (Also my mom, bless her, flew up again! Because I called her the morning of my CT scan because I was feeling overwhelmed, and after we got off the phone, she just happened to find a flight arriving right before my CT scan appointment.  She called me again as she was driving to the airport to tell me she was coming up just for moral support, and she literally arrived 5 minutes before the doctor told me to go to the ER.)</p>
                <p>It was such a relief to be out of that much pain.  Since it had been ramping up for about a week at that point, I was so absolutely exhausted that I didn't even care how uncomfortable sleeping on my side in that hospital bed was that I just slept through that pain like it was nothing.  They discharged me before noon the next day, and I essentially got home and just existed at home for the next week.  My mom stayed for a couple days to help my partner and I, but I mostly just laid on the couch and took baths per the surgeon's instructions. I finally started feeling a little more with it last weekend and being able to sit normally this week, so I went back to work on Thursday.  The hospital said everything looks like it's healing up well at my follow up appointment, so other than the frustration of having to take multiple baths a day, I am finally back to my normal routines.</p>
                <p>[End medical discussion]</p>
                <p>Through this whole last month, I've had this phrase "imperfect thiry" floating around my head.  I know a lot of people panic about turning 30 or try to make a big deal of it, but I've basically been waiting to step into my thirties since I was 26.  All of my friends who are older than me have said their 30s were great, and I've spent most of my 20s trying to heal and grow and unlearn a lot of behaviors/beliefs that were making my life more difficult to make way for that.  I know that work will continue for the rest of my life, but I'm comfortable with where I'm at and with my capacity to handle unexpected difficulties, and I have a good diversity of tools and habits now to manage my mental health.  Life moving forward will never be perfect or predictable, somethings will never get better, but I will be okay and find both my happiness and contentment on the way.</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodflower.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 03/13/2024 | Happy mid-week, folks!  Are you getting the stuff you need to best take care of yourself done?  Are you making time for the things that bring you joy and peace?  I'm still struggling to balance everything, but I've had a sudden burst of energy despite daylight savings (I won't lie, it feels a bit like an exhausted sort of energy, so I'm expecting a crash soon...) and I've been getting a lot of unpacking and cleaning done!  Mostly just, organizational and sorting stuff because all of our things have been very ungraciously boxed over a multitude of years, so I keep finding bits and bobs to move from one box to another to sort later.  It feels never ending!  But it also feels good to know what we have and to reclaim it.</p>
                <p>I've been easing myself back into spinning in the last couple of weeks, and I even managed to finish the first half of the merino I started spinning months and months ago now.  I just dized the second half while pondering what all I wanted to write tonight, and even though I wasn't enjoying it at first, I'm actually excited to see how this one turns out when I get to plying!  It's so strange how just a couple months away from my spindle has completely changed my mind about things, lol.  My parents also very kindly bought me a steamer for Christmas, so once I have these done, I'm going to just have a steaming day to finish all the yarn I've spun to date and hopefully get some pictures for my spinning page (and ravelry, which I have also been neglecting).</p>
                <p>The weather is supposed to turn warm this weekend, and I'm hoping that means the weather will be nice for my birthday later this month!  We got rained out of going on the short hike I wanted to do last year, but I'd really love to show my partner that trail this year if I can help it.  I don't have big plans, my partner took the day off for us to do something, but honestly I might have us go out for lunch and pick up a piece of cake from one of the fancy bakeries.  I'm too tired to plan anything this year!  But my mom pointed out that us being in our own place is more than exciting enough for a birthday at home.  Just a little calm before everything picks up for the summer, lol.</p>
                <p>I hope you're doing well this week, and I hope you're being kind to yourself!  Do something little for yourself, even if it's just to get up and get a drink of water.  Your future self will be grateful.  =3</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodheart.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 02/24/2024 | Goooooood morning, Neocities!  Been a little bit, though definitely not my longest break between entries.  I've been making my cozy nest and <a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/742984861518790656/the-new-screws-i-bought-were-just-right-and-i">modifying Ikea furniture</a>, and honestly, I've been keeping myself so busy that I've barely had time to just do fun stuff to recharge!  So that's what today is, and the only real work I'm doing is cooking dinner in the crock pot.<p>
                <p>I've actually been cooking a lot and have been trying one or two new recipes a week, and we've been eating an absurd amount of pancakes.  (None of which is sustainable long term, but I am riding this high!)  I've even been able to refine my own recipes a little more since we can take up more space and use more ingredients.  I'll probably be adding links to those recipes <a href="../home/kitchen/recipes/index.html">later today</a> just because I'm enjoying the testing process and some of these are absolutely going into our normal rotation.</p>
                <p>Cooking is probably the only reason I haven't gone crazy this month since I've barely had a chance to unpack my hobby stuff (due to waiting on furniture assembly/modification).  I just realized my local fiber fair is only three months away!  And I haven't even started on any of the fiber that I got there last year, but I know that I'll want more haha.  I've actually been really thinking about seriously about finally getting a spinning wheel, so I'm trying to figure out some shops to go to to actually... try them out.  It feels like a big jump from literally spinning a stick with some weight to these mechanical objects I can only vagely name the parts of, but now that I know I enjoy spinning as much as I do  (and I finally got a steamer to finish my yarns!), this was always kind of the next step.</p>
                <p>Regardless, I'm just vibing at home today!  Website updates and tweaking, listening to records, watching the Monterey Bay Aquarium livecam, spinning while I ponder coding fixes (I was able to rescue one of my spindles and fiber from the pile of boxes finally this morning).  I need to make more time for the things that bring me joy as we move into spring, and I hope you can too. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodheart.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 01/26/2024 | Just a short little update because I wanted to journal, lol.  I've been very caught up in homemaking (because duh), and I'm having a great time.  I missed this!  This feeling of nesting and building and using my space, and it feels so good to be able to stretch those muscles!  It's mostly been functional stuff like touching up the kitchen organization, unpacking/washing all of our clothes and linens, and strategizing where to put what furniture and what we should add to the to buy list, but even that feels like such a big, happy change.  uwu  I was able to unpack my jewelry collection tonight (<a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/740632212226113536/very-important-move-in-additions">most importantly my earrings</a> which I would love to make a page for someday), and tomorrow I'm hoping to do some cable management and get our record player set up.  I desperately want to put some art up too, but my partner and I are going to do that together once things are a little more settled.  =3  Little by little it's becoming the home we've been dreaming about for years, and my heart feels so full.</p>

                <p><img src="../graphics/smol/moodpencil.gif" style="float:left;padding:5px;"> 01/12/2024 | Howdy from the new apartment!!!  It took longer than I intended, and I definitely overdid it on my poor knee that I injured last spring, but we so very happily in the apartment and we made it the week before the first freeze of the year out here in western Washington!  It's wild how quiet it is, and I'm so happy our cat adjusted super quickly.  She's still suspicious of the neighbor dogs barking, but she's having a blast exploring everying (including the places she shouldn't) and rolling around in the carpet after only having hardwood floors, which honestly, same.</p>
                <p>I haven't gotten to make anything fancy just yet, but it's been so nice to cook in a completely clear kitchen with the pots and pans and utensils that I know!  I've been brainstorming different things to make, especially now that I'll have access to my crockpot and my stand mixer again, so hopefully I can test out and refine some additions for my <a href="../home/kitchen/recipes/index.html">recipes</a> page.  I owe my coworkers some cobbler, and I want to cook some pumpkin cookies as a thank you to my partners managers and coworkers, so those will definitely get made in the near future!</p>
                <p>Tbh, the kitchen is the only room that's fully unpacked.  ^^;  I haven't even had a chance to reassemble our bedframe or start stocking the kitchen with more than ingredients for one pot meals.  I think a lot of things are going to end up getting trashed/donated as I unpack, some more willingly than others.  I've grown in a lot of ways so I'm ready to let go of some things like old projects that fell by the wayside when the pandemic started, but as with my kitchen goods, I am steeling myself to find things I'll have to grieve and toss because they're damaged and unrepairable.  It'll be a slow going process, but I know I'll feel better to be free of the weight of it looming over me.</p>
                <p>While I haven't had a chance to do more in Furcadia, I have been keeping up with Chicken Smoothie and Neopets and maybe I shouldn't have poked around the CS forums because now I'm finding more games that I kinda want to pick up.  I'm debating even figuring out Flight Rising again!!  There's something to be said about having a game to sit down and engage with, but I've been enjoying the few-minutes-here-and-there style of play for the pet games.  Maybe that's just been because of my limited time and energy this past month, and I know if I'm not careful, I'm going to completely overwhelm myself, but *cough*ifyouhaveanyrecssendthemmyway*cough*.</p>
