          <center><h2>My Media Library</h2></center>
          <p>This is a multimedia library just like your local library probably is.  You'll find my music collection here as well as my sparse movie selection.  My CD collection is carefully curated and always digitized just in case, tho some of these I've managed to acquire digitally while I still hunt or wait to buy physical copies.  I only own a handful of records (my partner's desire to collect has rubbed off on me a bit!) but I'll include them here eventually because they're neat.  My movie collection is fairly small because I really only buy movies that I know I want to watch over again or that are really important to me, and the other few are ones I've recived as gifts from others (including my parents who just gutted their own DVD collection and sent a bunch of stuff my way).</p>
          <h3>artists & bands</h3>

           <img src="music/brighteyes.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="bright eyes cassadaga" title="Cassadaga, Bright Eyes, 2007 [I actually own CDs of all of Bright Eyes' albums except the 2020 one, but I think this one is my favourite even if there are tracks off of some of the others that I enjoy more individually.]">
           <img src="music/chloemoriondo.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="rabbit hearted" title="Rabbit Hearted, Chloe Moriondo, 2018 [One of the few records I own!  It was a neat, jade green pressing, and I couldn't refuse.]">
          <h3>soundtracks & film scores</h3>
           <img src="music/awayost.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="away we go ost" title="Away We Go, Alexi Murdoch, 2009 [I don't want to have kids myself or start a family, but I love how this movie is about them being in love and moving forward together.  The soundtrack has always touched my heart in the same way.]">
           <img src="music/social.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="the social network ost" title="while my original introduction to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were edgy NIN AMVs on youtube as a wee teen, the score for this movie made a lasting impression and has played an integral part to many of my OCs over the years.">
           <img src="music/halo2.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="halo 2 ost" title="Halo 2: Original Soundtrack Volume One, Martin O'Donnell & Michael Salvatori, 2004 [I need you to know that I have never played a Halo game in my life, only watched bits of other people playing, but I love the (Bungie) Halo soundtracks a stupid amount.]">

           <img src="music/haloreach.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="halo reach ost" title="Halo: Reach Original Soundtrack, Martin O'Donnell & Michael Salvatori, 2010 [THE ONLY HALO GAME I HAVE ACTUALLY PLAYED, although not until 2021 and long, LONG after I had listened to this soundtrack for the first time.  My dad actually bought me an action figure of Kat in high school which I didn't fully appreciate until years later.]">
           <img src="music/gits.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="gits: sac ost" title="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T., Yoko Kanno, 2003 [Technically my dad's CD, but he know's I've called dibs should it ever be in danger of being gotten rid of.  ALSO the origin of my love for Yoko Kanno's music.  I was allowed to listen to this soundtrack long before my mom would let me watch the show (outside of the tachikoma shorts, lol), and it fucking slaps.]">
           <img src="music/noir1.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="noir ost i" title="Noir: Original Soundtrack I, Yuki Kaijura, 2001 [I am in desperate need of rewatching this series, but the music has been a constant companion to me since high school.  This was one of several anime OSTs that I asked for for Christmas my freshman year of high school and bless my parents for putting up with me.]">
           <img src="music/noir2.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="noir ost ii" title="Noir: Original Soundtrack II, Yuki Kaijura, 2001 [When I actually was practicing piano, I taught myself a couple of pieces from this album by ear.]">

Wolf's Rain did something to my brain the first time I watched it, and I periodically am compelled to engage with it.]">
           <img src="music/wolfsrain2.jpg" style="max-width:100px;" alt="wolf's rain ost 2" title="Wolf's Rain Original Soundtrack 2, Yoko Kanno, 2004 [It KILLS me that this album was never released in the US, and I don't know how my parents managed to get this album for me but THEY DID, and I am eternally grateful more than a decade later because it has some of my favourite songs from the series on it.]">
