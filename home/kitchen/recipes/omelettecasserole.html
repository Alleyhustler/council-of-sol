              <p>My partner really loves Denver omelettes.  He gets them every time we go out for breakfast regardless of if we go to ihop or mom n pop breakfast places, and while I don't really like making omelettes, I <em>did</em> want to make a breakfast casserole.  I'm pretty sure we're going to be making this a couple times a month for the forseeable future, lol.</p>
              <p>Realistically, you can customize this however you want.  The bones of it truly are the hashbrowns and the egg mixture, so feel free to sub the meat/veggies/cheese for whatever strikes your fancy (or whatever you have on hand).  I'll probably be playing around with some other variations in the future, but I wanted to be true to the Denver omelette to make my partner smile. =3</p>
              <p>While the cooking time is only 65 minutes total, I'd probably give yourself an hour and a half for getting this made.</p>
              <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>15 oz frozen, shredded hash browns</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (2 oz) butter</li>
                <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 a large yellow or white onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 bell pepper, diced</li>
                <li>8 oz cubed ham</li>
                <li>12 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup (1/2 pint) heavy cream</li>
                <li>8 oz cheese</li>
                <li>Seasonings to your preference</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Directions</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>Add 15 oz frozen hash browns to 9x13 casserole dish.</li>
                <li>Melt butter and mix in salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Evenly pour over hashbrowns and mix.</li>
                <li>Bake the hash browns fo 20-25 minutes until they're looking a little crispy.</li>
                <li>While hashbrowns are baking, sautee the onion and bell pepper to make them a little more flavorful prior to baking.  You could also fry the ham a little bit for some extra crispy bits (and to remove excess liquid), but that's more up to you.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and cream.  Add in salt, pepper, and your seasonings as well.</li>
                <li>When the hash browns are ready, add the following to the casserole dish ensureing they're evenly spread out: veggies, ham, cheese, egg mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20 minutes at 400.  Reduce heat to 350 and bake for additional 20 minutes or until edges are browned and the center does not wiggle.</li>
                <li>For the love of your tongue, let it cool for like ten minutes before serving or trying to devour.  Top with whatever you normally add to your omelettes.  I like hot sauce (shocker), and my partner loves ketchup.  Some salsa, guac, and or sour cream would be good too tho...</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Notes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The proportions in this recipe are such that if the ingredients are doubled, they are conveniently the sizes that the pre-packaged ingredientss are sold in at my grocery store.  This is 1000% intentional, so honestly, adjust your proportions based on your tastes and what's available to you.</li>
                <li>The egg:hash brown ratio is super flexible.  When I was looking at other recipes, I saw people use anywhere from 20 oz hasbrowns and 12 eggs to 30 oz hashbrowns and 8 eggs.</li>
                <li>ALSO, tater tots instead of hasbhrowns?  Absolutely delicious.  Super worth the splurge.</li>
                <li>Similarly, the amount of cheese tended to be somewhere between 2 and 3 cups.  Follow your heart.</li>
                <li>Speaking of the cheese, if you wanna be fancy, mix a couple types together!  We've tried medium cheddar and monterey jack, but I'd really like to try it with swiss and cheddar.  Also for consideration: pepper jack, sharp white cheddar, and almost any specialty cheese from Tillamook because I have a problem.</li>
                <li>I don't normally have heavy cream on hand unless I know I'll need it ahead of time, so if you need to substitute, try 1 cup evaporated milk or you could do 3/4 cup milk mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter.</li>
                <li>For the seasonings, the world is your oyster.  I've been mixing things like paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, mustard powder, and/or cumin based on my mood.  I might try taco seasoning at some point? (edit 11/14/2022: taco seasoning is gr9, love putting it on the hashbrowns and in the egg mixture!) Once again, follow your heart.</li>
                <li>For the veggies, you can totally use a frozen mix!  Remove excess liquid when you're sauteeing them.</li>
              </ul>
