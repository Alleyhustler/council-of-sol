              <p>Another recipe made at the request of the love of my life.  Meatloaf feels like such an Americana dinner staple, but it was never something that my family made, so I had an adventure researching different recipes to find a flavor profile and consistency that I knew he would love.</p>
              <p>Usually around an hour and a half of cooking time, so something I like to save for making on my days off, buuuuuuut it does feed us for like three meals, so great to make at the start of the work week!</p>
              <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>1/2 large onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 carrot, finely shredded</li>
                <li>1 stick of celery, finely diced</li>
                <li>2 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tbsp bbq sauce</li>
                <li>Milk (see below for amount)</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper, garlic poweder to taste (don't be shy, you're seasoning a lot of meat)</li>
                <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (i use the unseasoned ones)</li>
                <li>3lbs ground beef (or whatever, i'm not the boss of you)</li>
                <li>Glaze: 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Directions</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>Sautee the onion, carrot, and celery until translucent.  Set aside to cool</li>
                <li>Add the worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and bbq sauce to a measuring cup.  Add milk to the 1 cup marker, then add the eggs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Mix well.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the breadcrumbs and set aside to soak for 5-10 minutes</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add the ground beef and mix in the breadcrumb mixture and cooled veggies <em>really well</em>.  The first few times I made this, I underestimated how much I needed to mix it.  Just keep going.  (I highly recommend using disposable gloves for this step.)</li>
                <li>Shape into three loaves on baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven, add glaze to the loaves with a basting brush.  Cook for another 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven to glaze the loaves again.  Cook for a final 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 155.</li>
                <li>Let those bad boys rest for like 10-15 minutes!  I usually use this opportunity to cook some veggies as a side.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Notes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>For the meat, I tend to pick lower fat to reduce the amount of drippings I have after.  Also, highly recommend covering your pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up.</li>
              </ul>
