              <p>As any personal cookbook should be, this space is a work in progress!  I'll be working on putting up my recipes slowly and in some cases a couple versions so we can adapt for time/spoons as needed.  =3</p>
              <p>(Also, you can find my notes on reheating things, recipes/techniques i want to try, recipes i'm working on refining, and odd and end notes can be found <a href="../notes.html">here</a> because I forget generic things like temperatures/times for cooking stuff a lot.)</p>
              <h3>My Recipes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="omelettecasserole.html">Denver Omelette Casserole</a></li>
                <li><a href="shepherdspie.html">Lazy Shepherd's Pie</a></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Recipes I've Tried</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://chasety.com/buffalo-chicken-mac-cheese/">Buffalo Chicken Mac n Cheese</a> - This is so rich, but I could eat it every day for a week.  Comfort food to the max.</li>
                <li><a href="https://dinnerthendessert.com/chicken-bacon-ranch-tater-tot-casserole/">Chicken Bacon Ranch Tater Tot Casserole</a> - Enjoyed how easy this was to put together and have with a veggie side.  I'll be working to tweak the flavors as I think it needs the ranch flavor to shine through a little more, but I <em>highly</em> recommend a low/no sodium cream of chicken soup and seasoning to your taste.</li>
                <li><img src="../../../graphics/smol/new.gif" style="padding-right:3px;"><a href="https://thecozycook.com/broccoli-cheddar-chicken-and-rice-casserole/">Chicken Broccoli Rice Casserole</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.thecomfortofcooking.com/2021/09/one-pot-creamy-beef-and-shells.html">Creamy Beef and Shells</a> - Super cozy comfort meal.  Added closer to 12oz of pasta which felt like a better proportion to me!</li>
                <li><a href="https://thecookinchicks.com/creamy-cajun-sausage-pasta/">Creamy Cajun Sausage Pasta</a> - Added onions and bell peppers for some veg.</li>
                <li><img src="../../../graphics/smol/new.gif" style="padding-right:3px;"><a href="https://www.saltandlavender.com/creamy-chicken-tortilla-soup/#wprm-recipe-container-36233">Creamy Chicken Tortilla Soup</a> - Followed this recipe and loved the flavor, doubled the amount of chicken broth though as it was nooooot soupy enough for us.</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/creamy-pepper-jack-pasta/">Creamy Pepper Jack Pasta</a> - Would like to try adding a lil more pepperoncini juice next time.  It really adds a nice pop of flavor!</li>
                <li><a href="https://tornadoughalli.com/one-pot-creamy-sausage-gnocchi/">Creamy Sausage Gnocchi</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.galonamission.com/one-pot-creamy-tomato-tortellini-soup/">Creamy Tomato Tortellini Soup</a> - This is just a solid tomato soup recipe even without the tortellini.  I did use my immersion blender to smooth it out (just personal preference), and I think I'll add some grated carrot to add a hint of sweetness next go.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.persnicketyplates.com/crockpot-honey-garlic-meatballs">Honey Garlic Meatballs</a> - I recommend reducing the amount of soy sauce to 3/4 cup to balance the savory and sweet better, and my sauce never thickens enough which has been fixed by adding a little corn starch toward the end of cooking.</li>
                <li><a href="https://30minutesmeals.com/one-pot-chicken-fajita-pasta/">One-pot Chicken Fajita Pasta</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://cyberneticdryad.tumblr.com/post/721686495687294976/maddiesharafian-its-delicious-i-promise">Pork & Cabbage Over Rice</a> - Another really versatile recipe (if you love cabbage, lol).  I'd like to make this as written, but I subbed the olive oil for sesame oil, added a little soy sauce to my broth, and added twoish tablespoons of brown sugar, and it tasted  d i v i n e.  I also added one julienned carrot and some green onions to zazz it up a bit, but it really didn't need it.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.persnicketyplates.com/southwest-chicken-skillet/">Rotel Southwest Chicken Skillet</a> - Super versatile recipe.  Add beans, add more topings, use ground beef instead of chicken, put it on a tortilla.  I basically used to make this in my rice cooker, but the tomato sauce makies it nicer.  I'm also lazy and have just been using taco seasoning in place of the suggested spices.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.thecookierookie.com/crockpot-swedish-meatballs/">Swedish Meatballs</a> - May double the sauce next time we have it with mashed potatoes!</li>
